Progress:
We all can connect with the car via mobile hotspot and those who have andriod phones are able to drive it via the app.
We can ssh to the moped and look at the files.
We have set up a server but it crashed so we will move it a more stable server.

Problems:
First week we had low work morale
Organitation wise we have not been doing it in a good way.
therefore we have not completed as many tasks as we had hoped.
We are also not used to working this freely with not as much guidance as in
previouys courses, which makes starting out a bigger hastle than usual.

Questions:  
Is it okay to have the MOPEDS organised before starting coloumn driving?
Is it enough to drive with only sensors?
Product Backlog?
Why is the documentation non generell?
