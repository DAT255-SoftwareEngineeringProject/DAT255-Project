# SYSTEM VISION:

The software is aimed towards RISE SICS. It will reduce the need of human labor since the companies will not have to hire human truck-drivers. This will reduce costs and increase traffic safety. It is important that the sensor functionality works. If the software that handles the sensorâ€™s input is flawed, a truck can suddenly become a risk for traffic and its surroundings. 
It is also important that the software performs well and should therefore be well tested. Autonomous trucks are an investment for the future in the sense of fuel cost savings, instead the money can go into other projects. 
This system will also increase road safety as a whole, since self driven trucks and cars have been proven to be safer than ones driven by humans. The work will be more effective and completed faster without the human factor being an obstacle. The software should be completed within 6 weeks. 
Our software will help to reduce fuel consumption for trucks, and especially when they are driven as a convoy. It will also be more safe than a human driver.
